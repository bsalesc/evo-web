  <h1>Table Accessibility</h1>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <p>
    In order to be well-formed and appear in the accessibility tree for
    assistive technology, a table
    <strong>requires</strong>
    the table head (
    <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>
    ) and table body (
    <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>
    ) elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every table cell
    <strong>requires</strong>
    a logical column header and/or row header.
  </p>
  <p>
    Columns with string data should be left aligned, while columns with numeric
    data should be right aligned (vice versa for RTL).
  </p>
  <p>
    A table accessibility may be enhanced by adding a
    <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>
    to relay the subject of the table.
  </p>
  <p>
    A sortable table is a table that allows users to sort the data in the table
    by clicking on the column headers. You can make tables sortable by using
    sort buttons in
    <code>thead &gt; th</code>
    . Additionally, for accessibility purposes,
    <code>aria-sort=&quot;ascending&quot;</code>
    or
    <code>aria-sort=&quot;descending&quot;</code>
    should be added respectively to the
    <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>
    to reflect the current sort order.
  </p>
  <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
  <p>
    This section provides interaction design for keyboard, screen reader and
    pointing devices.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    The top-level container element should have a
    <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code>
    to make it focusable, an
    <code>aria-label</code>
    or
    <code>aria-labeledby</code>
    to relay context of the table, and should have a
    <code>role=&quot;group&quot;</code>
    to make it accessible to screen readers. That will also allow the
    table elements to be scrollable inside the container, both vertically (when
    overflowing) and horizontally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tabbing order for interactive elements inside a table need to follow the
    natural sequencing of the elements as they appear row by row from top to
    bottom, and column by column per the respective RTL/LTR modes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sortable columns are achieved by adding a tri-state button (at rest, toggled
    sort descending, toggled sort ascending) as the contents of the table header
    cell. The three states would be cycled through on click/tap/keyboard as
    such: Rest &gt; Sort Descending &gt; Sort Ascending &gt; Rest …
  </p>
  <p>
    The usual rules for
    <a href=`${urls.accessibility}/input/button`>
      button
    </a>
    apply.
  </p>
  <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
  <p>
    Table
    <strong>must</strong>
    be listed in screen reader list of tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Screen reader
    <strong>must</strong>
    be navigable with screen reader table command. For example, in
    VoiceOver this command is
    <code>VO+CMD+T</code>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Screen reader
    <strong>must</strong>
    announce value of every cell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Screen reader
    <strong>must</strong>
    announce value of column header when instructed to do so. For example,
    in VoiceOver this command is
    <code>VO+C</code>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Sortable column
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announced by screen reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    Current sort state of sortable columns
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announce by screen reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    When moving from column to column, screen reader announces new column scope.
    Typically this scope is the value of the column header.
  </p>
  <p>
    When moving from row to row, screen reader announces new row scope.
    Typically this scope is the value of the row header.
  </p>
  <h3>Pointer</h3>
  <p>
    The only special consideration for table is sortable columns. Typically this
    is achieved by adding a toggle button as the contents of the table header
    cell. The usual rules for
    <a href=`${urls.accessibility}/input/button`>
      button
    </a>
    apply.
  </p>
  <h2>ARIA Reference</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>aria-sort</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Applied to column headings to convey descending or ascending sorted
          stated.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
