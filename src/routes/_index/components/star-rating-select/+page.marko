<p>
    Star rating select allows users to interact with and set a star rating.
    Typically allows user to allocate a rating of 1 to 5, and may also allow
    half-values.
  </p>

  <p>
    Star rating select uses radio buttons under the hood so even in the absence
    of CSS, its gracefully degradation should allow for full accessible
    interactivity and use.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a non-interactive star rating, refer
    <a href=`${urls.components}/star-rating`>
      star-rating
    </a>
    pattern.
  </p>
</div>
