  <h1>Menu Accessibility</h1>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <p>
    To avoid confusion with form-based checkboxes and radios (which have different behaviour), menuitem checkboxes and radios should be styled differently (e.g. with a tick).
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, a menu is not a form control. Its purpose is
    <strong>not</strong>
    to store or submit data via form submission. A menu, like a button, is
    a mechanism to execute JavaScript, and therefore is 100% dependent on
    JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are concerned that the functionality of the menu must be available in
    a non-JavaScript state, then perhaps a menu is not the best choice. Consider
    form controls instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding, modifying or deleting records (e.g. CRUD) could be considered
    critical functionality. Filtering and sorting search results could be
    considered non-critical.
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting a command
    <em>should not</em>
    fully reload the page (use a
    <a href=`${urls.accessibility}/patterns/fake-menu-button`>
      fake menu
    </a>
    instead).
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting a command
    <strong>must</strong>
    perform a JavaScript action on the client (e.g. AJAX request then
    partial page re-render).
  </p>
  <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
  <p>
    This section provides interaction design for keyboard, screen reader &amp;
    pointing devices.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    The menu itself does not receive focus; focus
    <strong>must</strong>
    go to the first item in the menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>UP-ARROW</code>
    and
    <code>DOWN-ARROW</code>
    keys
    <strong>must</strong>
    navigate keyboard focus through commands via roving tabindex mechanism
    (skipping any that are disabled).
  </p>
  <p>
    If focus is on a command,
    <code>ENTER</code>
    or
    <code>SPACEBAR</code>
    keys
    <strong>must</strong>
    activate that command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>TAB</code>
    key must move keyboard focus off menu, and onto next interactive
    element in the page.
  </p>
  <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
  <p>
    Commands
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announced as “menu item”, “menu item radio” or “menu item checkbox”
    role.
  </p>
  <p>
    Checkbox and radio command state
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announced as checked or unchecked.
  </p>
  <p>Disabled commands must be announced as disabled.</p>
  <h3>Pointer</h3>
  <p>
    Clicking any menu item
    <strong>must</strong>
    activate that command.
  </p>
  <h2>ARIA Reference</h2>
  <p>
    This section gives an overview of our use of ARIA, within the specific
    context of the menu pattern.

          Informs assistive technology that the divs around groups of menu items
          are for presentation purposes only and should not be added to
          accessibility tree.

          behaviour.

          aria-selected.
