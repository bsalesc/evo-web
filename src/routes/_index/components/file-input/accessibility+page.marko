  <h1>File Input Accessibility</h1>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <p>
    File input
    <strong>must</strong>
    have an accessible label, such as “Browse files.”
  </p>
  <p>
    File input
    <em>should</em>
    support drag-and-drop, to allow for multiple interaction options. Most
    browsers now support drag-and-drop for file input fields by default.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended to include helper text to inform the user about the
    availability of drag-and-drop and any constraints on file size or type.
  </p>
  <h3>Visual Display</h3>
  <p>
    By default, browsers display file input fields as a composite of two
    elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A file selector button, with text like “Browse…” or “Choose File”</li>
    <li>Text displaying the selected file name(s), or “No file(s) selected”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To provide a larger, more prominent interaction target, authors
    <em>may</em>
    visually obscure these elements in favor of a visual container that
    includes the field label, helper text, and/or additional visual elements.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the default file selector button is obscured, the container
      <strong>must</strong>
      display a clear call to action. This could be the field’s label,
      e.g. “Browse files.”
    </li>
    <li>
      If the default selected file display is obscured, there
      <strong>must</strong>
      be another visual representation of the files to be submitted.
      <a href=`${urls.accessibility}/messaging/file-preview-card`>
        File preview cards
      </a>
      are one way to accomplish this.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    File input
    <strong>must</strong>
    be keyboard focusable (unless disabled). Any custom styling
    <strong>must</strong>
    ensure a clear focus state distinct from unfocused state.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the file input has keyboard focus, pressing
    <code>ENTER</code>
    or
    <code>SPACEBAR</code>

    <strong>must</strong>
    open the operating system’s native file browser, where the user can
    use their operating system’s typical file browsing controls to navigate and
    select file(s).
  </p>
  <h3>Screen reader</h3>
  <p>
    The file input
    <strong>must</strong>
    announce its label to screen reader users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The file input
    <strong>must</strong>
    announce its role to screen reader users.
  </p>
  <h3>Pointer</h3>
  <p>
    Clicking the file input field or its label
    <strong>must</strong>
    open the operating system’s native file browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended that file input also support drag-and-drop. The entire
    file input container should be treated as a drop zone; dragging and dropping
    files directly onto the file input field’s container
    <em>should</em>
    select the file(s) for upload.
  </p>
