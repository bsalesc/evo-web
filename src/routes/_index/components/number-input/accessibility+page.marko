  <h1>Number Input Accessibility</h1>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Number input:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The decrease button must be disabled when the value is at its minimum.
          Similarly, the increase button must be disabled when the value is at
          its maximum.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quantity input:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For fields with a minimum value greater than 0, authors may add a
          delete button that appears in place of the decrease button when the
          value reaches its minimum.
        </li>
        <li>
          The delete button must be after the input field in the DOM and tab
          order, even if it appears visually before it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pressing the delete button should remove the entire number input.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
  <p>
    This section provides interaction guidelines for keyboard, screen reader,
    and pointing devices.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    The input field
    <strong>must</strong>
    respect all the default keyboard interactions for an HTML input field
    of type=“number”. With focus on the input field, user can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Type a numeric value</li>
    <li>
      Press UP arrow to increment the value, up to the max value (if one is set)
    </li>
    <li>
      Press DOWN arrow to decrement the value, down to the min value (if one is
      set)
    </li>
    <li>
      TAB to next focusable element on the page, SHIFT + TAB to previous
      focusable element
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The increase and decrease buttons
    <em>should</em>
    not be keyboard accessible.
  </p>
  <p>
    For quantity input, the delete button
    <strong>must</strong>
    follow
    <a href=`${urls.components}/button/accessibility`>
      all standard button keyboard interactions
    </a>
    . After deleting an entry, focus must move to the nearest focusable
    element.
  </p>
  <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
  <p>
    The input field
    <strong>must</strong>
    be reachable with a screen reader (even when disabled).
  </p>
  <p>
    The input field
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announced as an input of type number.
  </p>
  <p>
    The input field’s label
    <strong>must</strong>
    be announced.
  </p>
  <p>
    The increase and decrease buttons
    <em>should</em>
    be hidden from the screen reader to avoid redundancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    For quantity input, the delete button
    <strong>must</strong>
    convey its accessible label, e.g. “Delete item.”
  </p>
  <h3>Pointer</h3>
  <p>
    Clicking the increase or decrease buttons
    <strong>must</strong>
    adjust the value by one and return focus to the input field, so that
    the user can easily switch between pointer and keyboard input as desired.
  </p>
