  <h1>Badge Accessibility</h1>
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <p>
    Badges must use
    <code>role=&quot;img&quot;</code>
    with
    <code>aria-label</code>
    to convey their meaning to assistive technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Badges are typically non-interactive visual indicators. If a badge needs to
    be interactive, it should be placed within an interactive element (such as a
    button or link) that has an appropriate accessible name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not rely solely on color to convey the meaning or status of a badge.
    Ensure that the badge’s purpose is clear through its label and context.
  </p>
  <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
  <p>
    This section provides detailed instructions for how different input types
    should navigate and operate the pattern.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    Badge elements are not interactive by default and therefore should not be
    keyboard focusable.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a badge is placed within an interactive element (such as a button or
    link), the interactive element must be keyboard accessible via
    <strong>TAB</strong>
    key.
  </p>
  <h3>Screen Reader</h3>
  <p>
    A screen reader will announce the badge as an image along with its
    <code>aria-label</code>
    value (e.g., “2 notifications, image”).
  </p>
  <h3>Pointer</h3>
  <p>
    Badge elements are not interactive by default and therefore are not
    clickable.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a badge is placed within an interactive element (such as a button or
    link), clicking the badge will activate that interactive element.
