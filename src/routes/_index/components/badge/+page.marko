  <p>
    A badge is a visual indicator added to an element to convey quantity,
    newness or both. Badges are intended to remind a user of previous actions
    taken, or to alert them of new actions that they should consider.

    The badge module contains the basic, base styles for a static badge element.
    Badges can also be placed inside of the
    <a href=`${urls.components}/icon-button#icon-button-badged`>
      icon button
    </a>
    and
    <a href=`${urls.components}/menu#menu-badged`>
      menu
    </a>
    modules.
