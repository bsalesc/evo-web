  <h1>Setting Focus on Page Load</h1>
  <p>
    In typical web documents (as opposed to
    <em>applications</em>
    ), setting keyboard focus on page load creates more disadvantages than
    advantages for users of assistive technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    You
    <strong>must not</strong>
    set focus on page load without strong justification that it does not
    create a barrier for users of assistive technology.
  </p>
  <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      creates an inconsistency in navigation within the site/subsite since most
      pages do not set focus on page load
    </li>
    <li>
      sighted keyboard users that rely on keyboard shortcuts for navigation
      (Page Down/Spacebar, End, etc.) will need to leave the context of the text
      input in order to navigate
    </li>
    <li>
      screen reader users that rely on shortcuts for navigation will either need
      to leave the context of the input or exit “forms” mode in order to
      navigate
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>mouse users are saved one click</li>
    <li>
      can bring users attention to a
      <strong>critical</strong>
      error message
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Exceptions</h2>
  <p>
    Specific MIND Patterns, such as
    <a href=`${urls.components}/page-notice`>
      Page Notice
    </a>
    , may direct you to set focus on page load for critical error cases.
