  <h1>Roving Tabindex</h1>
  <p>
    A roving tab index is a technique whereby only one collection element is in
    the sequential tab order and can have focus at any given time (i.e. has a
    tabindex value of zero). All other elements have a negative tabindex. We can
    say the collection is now more widget-like, as it takes one TAB key press to
    enter the widget, and one TAB key press to exit the widget. A user changes
    the roving tabindex state and focus by using the ARROW keys.

  <p>
    Compare this to
    <a href=`${urls.accessibility}/techniques/active-descendant`>
      active-descendant
    </a>
    based navigation where focus always remains on one element (usually a
    textbox), but has the
    <em>appearance</em>
    of moving elsewhere when using the arrow keys.

    Components that utilize a roving tab index are
    <a href=`${urls.components}/menu`>
      menu
    </a>
    and
    <a href=`${urls.components}/tabs`>
      tabs
    </a>
    .
